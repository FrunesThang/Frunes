//Unprocessed input balances are burned. Surplus balance based on checkpoint is burned.
//If inputs contain different token sources after recursion, all balances are destroyed. 1 UTXO carries 1 kind of Token.
//To prevent fabricated transfer processes, (C,F,A,B,E) ops' txid must start with the first 6 hex digits of their tickname.
//Fractional truncation, burning, and destruction may occur, but total token supply will ultimately inflate.
//If deep mixing or fake sources are detected, the UTXO and its fake transfer chains must be banned until their descendant outputs can't 
	pollute the whole Tx(outputs not prescribed by OP_RETURN or are Non-Frunes then become normal). Faulty UTXOs may burden wallets.
//During the development of the Frunes protocol, we encountered the tick "Qlc7eV" in txid:
